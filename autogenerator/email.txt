Title:
Integrating Side Channel Security into the High Level Synthesis based Design Flow


When:
November 13, 2023 13:15-14:15


Where:
in EDIT 8103
and over Zoom [https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09]


Abstract:
In the Internet of Things era, edge devices have been considerably diversified and are often designed using high level synthesis (HLS), which translates behavioral descriptions into hardware descriptions, for improved design productivity. However, HLS tools were originally developed in a security-unaware manner, resulting in vulnerabilities to side-channel attacks. In our recent work that was published at ACM Trans. on Embedded Computing Systems, we integrated side-channel security in the state-of-the-art high-level-synthesis-based hardware design flow, leveraging a provably countermeasure called the threshold implementation. As case studies for lightweight block ciphers composed of addition/rotation/XOR (ARX)-based permutations, our evaluation using an FPGA board demonstrated that our proposed method can successfully improve the side-channel security for all ARX-based ciphers used as benchmarks.
