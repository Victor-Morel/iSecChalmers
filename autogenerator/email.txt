Title:
Rethinking Privacy with Pointwise Maximal Leakage


When:
March 25, 2025 13:00-14:00


Where:
in EDIT 8103
and over Zoom [https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09]


Abstract:
In this talk, I will discuss the problem of privacy-preserving statistical analysis. I will start with an introduction to _differential privacy_, a key framework in this area. Then, I will present _pointwise maximal leakage (PML)_, a privacy measure that I developed during my PhD studies. PML quantifies the amount of information leaking about a secret  when releasing the outcome of a randomized function calculated on the secret. I will draw connections between PML and differential privacy while also highlighting their differences. Additionally, I will discuss an application where private information is sanitized while guaranteeing privacy in the sense of PML. Finally, I will explore open questions, current, and future research directions.
