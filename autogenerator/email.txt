Title:
Experimental Analyses of the Physical Surveillance Risks in Client-side Content Scanning


When:
March 13, 2024 13:30-14:30


Where:
in EDIT 8103
and over Zoom [https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09]


Abstract:
Content scanning systems employ perceptual hashing algorithms to scan user content for illicit material, such as child pornography or terrorist recruitment flyers. Perceptual hashing algorithms help determine whether two images are visually similar while preserving the privacy of the input images. Several efforts from industry and academia propose scanning on client devices such as smartphones due to the impending rollout of end-to-end encryption that will make server-side scanning difficult. These proposals have met with strong criticism because of the potential for the technology to be misused for censorship. However, the risks of this technology in the context of surveillance are not well understood.
This talk will discuss results from our experimental investigation of physical surveillance risks in these systems. Concretely:  (1) we offer a definition of physical surveillance in the context of client-side image scanning systems; (2) we experimentally characterize this risk; (3) we experimentally study the trade-off between the robustness of client-side image scanning systems and surveillance, showing that more robust detection of illicit material leads to an increased potential for physical surveillance in most settings.
