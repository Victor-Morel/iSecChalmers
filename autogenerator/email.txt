Dear all,

It's our pleasure to announce the upcoming talk of Chalmers Security & Privacy Seminar, given by Lucia Lavagnino.

Hoping to see many of you there!


Best regards,

Title:
Consistency-or-Die: Consistency for Key Transparency (interview for PhD position)


When:
October 17, 2024 13:15-14:15


Where:
in EDIT 8103



Abstract:
In this seminar I will present the paper that lies the foundation for the phd position I applied to. Key Transparency Log are an emerging technique to provide a secure and transparent way to manage and distribute cryptographic keys in centralised systems such as WhatsApp and iMessage. This paper (by Brorsson et al) presents a new way to prevent split-view attacks in Key Transparency Logs by leveraging light-weight and scalable cryptographic tools.
This seminar will have a special setting, as it serves as a PhD interview.
