Title:
Fast Attack Recovery for Stochastic Cyber-Physical Systems


When:
May 02, 2024 13:15-14:15


Where:
in EDIT 8103
and over Zoom [https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09]


Abstract:
The threat and severe consequences (financial or otherwise) of ransomware in traditional desktop- and handheld-based computer systems have been well documented in the literature. The same cannot be said for systems comprising constrained, embedded IoT devices used in industrial applications: When it comes to ransomware, the landscape is still largely unexplored. In industrial settings, IoT devices have started being considered for the control of mission-critical systems. A simultaneous or almost-simultaneous ransomware attack on a very large number of devices could prove very disruptive, costly, or outright dangerous. An attack of this nature could for example disrupt the operation of IoT-enabled supply chains, compromise food production by targeting smart agriculture settings, cause unforeseeable consequences to the power grid through compromise of smart metering or electric car charging infrastructure, or even endanger lives by tampering with actuators in factories or transport systems. The CHARIOT EPSRC-funded project aims to devise, design, and prototype methods to prevent, detect, recover from and immunise against ransomware attacks in resource-constrained industrial IoT environments. In this talk I will present the projectâ€™s progress to date, as well as some prior work on anomaly detection that led to this research activity at Bristol.

Speaker's bio:
Luis Burbano is a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz, advised by Professor Alvaro Cardenas. He received a bachelor's and master's in electronics engineering from Universidad de los Andes, Colombia, in 2017 and 2019, respectively. He was selected as a cyber-physical systems Rising Star in 2023 and is participating in the ELLIIT focus period in 2024. He is interested in the security of cyber-physical systems, integrating control theory and computer science formal methods.
