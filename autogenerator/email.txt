Title:
Adoption and Implementation of QNAME Minimization in DNS


When:
April 11, 2024 13:15-14:15


Where:
in EDIT 8103
and over Zoom [https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09]


Abstract:
The presentation delves into the critical aspects of QNAME Minimization within
the DNS, presenting an in-depth analysis through two key studies. The first
segment, "Adoption of QNAME Minimization," presents the main takeaways from "A
Second Look at QNAME Minimization" (PAM, 2023). This study provides insights
into how QNAME Minimization has been embraced across different platforms and
its implications for privacy and performance in DNS lookups.  The second
segment, "Implementation of QNAME Minimization," introduces new research on
fingerprinting DNS resolvers by leveraging the query patterns emerging from
QNAME Minimization. This study, currently under submission, aims to shed light
on the plethora of implementation approaches to minimizing queries and how
these differences can be used to fingerprint resolver software and versions.
Through these studies, the presentation aims to foster a deeper understanding
of DNS resolver dynamics, highlighting the importance of QNAME Minimization in
bolstering DNS privacy.
