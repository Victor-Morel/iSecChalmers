title: "How have threat models changed since 2018 and how hardware security can help handle the new threats?" 

event: Live talk in lecture hall EE 
#event_url: https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09 

summary: |-
 Since the disclosure of Spectre attacks in 2018, both academia and industry have made considerable efforts to defend against all variants of transient execution attacks, the class of attacks to which Spectre belongs to. The first part of this presentation will be dedicated to discovering how these attacks change the way we reason about threat models in security. The second part of the presentation will introduce a new generic formal processor model - called ProSpeCT - to prevent transient execution attacks by construction. ProSpeCT has also been implemented on top of an open-source RISC-V processor and will be presented in Usenix Security 23 in a joint work with Lesly-Ann Daniel, Marton Bognar, Job Noorman, Sébastien Bardin, and Frank Piessens.

[Tamara Rezk](https://www-sop.inria.fr/lemme/Tamara.Rezk/) is a research director at Inria, Sophia Antipolis, France. Her main research interests are in the field of system security. She currently focuses her research on program analyses and principled methods to deal with transient execution attacks and JavaScript security.
She has supervised Ph.D. students on topics such as static and dynamic security analyses, web security, formal methods for security, secure compilation, and provable cryptography.
