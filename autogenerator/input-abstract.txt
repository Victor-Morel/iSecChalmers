Computer security research is on a long-running quest for a universal framework
to reason about security properties. Such a framework ought to be expressive
enough to capture any security policy conceived of, while also being independent
of syntactic details and enforcement mechanisms, applicable to any system on
which we may wish to impose security, and intuitive enough that humans can grasp
the meaning of any given property (and not experience surprises due to a false
sense of grasping).
In this talk, I will present a framework based on modal logic
which we have recently introduced in pursuit of these goals.
In our approach, we combine established techniques for modal reasoning about
knowledge with modalities of time and possible actions, and carefully distinguish
between agents' capabilities and the effects we wish to permit them to achieve.

As we show, our formalism can be used to represent various progress- and termination-(in)sensitive
variants of confidentiality, integrity, robust declassification and
transparent endorsement, for each of which we have proven equivalence to standard definitions.
The intuitive nature and closeness to semantic reality
of our approach allows us to make explicit
several hidden assumptions of these definitions, and identify potential
issues and subtleties with them, while also holding the promise
of formulating cleaner versions and future extension to entirely novel properties.
