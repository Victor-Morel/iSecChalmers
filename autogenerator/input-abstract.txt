In a world where cryptographic constructs are stuck in a race against faster algorithms, we propose a cosmic solution: why not root cryptographic provable delays in the speed of light? This paper introduces Sequential Communication Delay (SCD) in the Universal Composability framework, a functionality models communication channels where data is transmitted fashionably late. With our SCD proofs, we proposed the first constructions of a Verifiable Delay Function and a Publicly Verifiable Time-Lock Puzzle that do not rely on computational assumptions Say goodbye to the worries of computational speed-ups and hello to a time-delay rooted in the cosmos!
