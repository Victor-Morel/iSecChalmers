The last decade has seen a proliferation of code-reuse attacks in the context of web applications. These attacks target vulnerabilities in which attacker-controlled data exploits legitimate code fragments within the application’s codebase to execute a code chain that performs malicious computations, e.g. Remote Code Execution, on the attacker’s behalf. In this talk, we will discuss how principled large-scale static and dynamic code analysis helps in discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in high-profile server-side applications and their software supply chain, as well as existing defensive mechanisms.
