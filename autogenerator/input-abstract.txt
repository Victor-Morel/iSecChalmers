Software supply chain attacks exploit discrepancies between source code repositories and deployed artifacts, highlighting the need for rigorous integrity checks during the artifactâ€™s build process. As systems grow in complexity, preemptive measures are essential to ensure that the source code certifiably aligns with the deployed code. Modern software development relies heavily on third-party libraries sourced from registries like Maven Central, npm, and PyPI. However, these ecosystems have become prime targets for supply-chain attacks, introducing malware into and also shadowing trusted packages. Such attacks jeopardize both developers and users, compromising the integrity of their software supply chain. This presentation discusses recent supply chain attacks and proposed solutions. Additionally, we present Macaron, our open-source project from Oracle Labs offering a flexible checker framework and policy engine to detect and mitigate supply chain security threats, safeguarding software components and maintaining their security posture over the development lifecycle.
