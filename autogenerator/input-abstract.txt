In this seminar I will present the paper that lies the foundation for the phd position I applied to. Key Transparency Log are an emerging technique to provide a secure and transparent way to manage and distribute cryptographic keys in centralised systems such as WhatsApp and iMessage. This paper (by Brorsson et al) presents a new way to prevent split-view attacks in Key Transparency Logs by leveraging light-weight and scalable cryptographic tools.
This seminar will have a special setting, as it serves as a PhD interview.
