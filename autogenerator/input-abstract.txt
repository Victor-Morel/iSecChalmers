In this talk, Rune gives an overview of his research so far.
The first part of the talk covers Signal's initial handshake protocol
and transitioning to a post-quantum protocol. He has proposed a
post-quantum replacement protocol called SPQR [PKC:BFGJS22] and analyzed
the confidentiality [PKC:FieGun25] and deniability [PoPETS:FieJan24] of
PQXDH, the post-quantum protocol that Signal has deployed for the
initial handshake.
In the second part he presents his (impossibility) results on deniable
authentication against malicious verifiers and the implications for
Signal's initial handshake. [EPRINT:FieLan25]
In the third part he introduces the Beyond UnForgeability Features
(BUFF) for signature schemes [SP:CDFFJ21] and gives an overview how the
signature schemes in the NIST standardization process are doing wrt.
BUFF properties [SAC:DuzFieFis24].
