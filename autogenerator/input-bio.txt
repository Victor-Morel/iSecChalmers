George's research focuses on energy-efficient networking and security for severely constrained wireless embedded devices and the IoT, with an emphasis on industrial applications.
His objective is to invent and prototype algorithms that are optimised for constrained/low-capability, battery-powered devices without sacrificing performance and reliability.
Over the last few years he has been focussing on IEEE 802.15.4 / .15.4g networks, doing work that covers the entire 6LoWPAN/RPL stack. More specifically, he has made contributions in the areas of multicast forwarding; MAC layers with time-synchronisation (such as TSCH); congestion control; routing; neighbour discovery; service discovery. Within the same IoT context, he is also interested in secure software writing techniques; digital forensics; and software defined networking.

A lot of his work has been released as open source software and is distributed as part of the Contiki-NG operating system for the Internet of Things, an open-source project of which he iis a co-founder and steering group member. Most of the work is also part of the original Contiki OS, for which he used to serve as maintainer.
