title: "On Progressive and Efficient Verification of Digital Signatures"

event: hybrid talk in EDIT 8103 and online via Zoom
event_url: https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09

#location: Wowchemy HQ
#address:
#  street: 450 Serra Mall
#  city: Stanford
#  region: CA
#  postcode: '94305'
#  country: United States

summary: |-
  Common verification procedures for digital signatures return a
  decision (accept/reject) only at the very end of the execution. If
  interrupted prematurely, however, the verification process cannot
  infer any meaningful information about the validity of the given
  signature. This limitation is due to the algorithm design solely,
  and it is not inherit to signature verification. In this talk, I
  will present a formal framework to handle interruptions during
  signature verification and a generic way to devise alternative
  verification procedures that progressively build confidence on the
  final decision. Our transformation applies to a wide range of
  post-quantum secure schemes including the NIST finalist Rainbow.

Her research is focused on cryptography and security, with a special interest for homomorphic cryptosystems, data authentication and user privacy. Prior to joining Lund University, Elena has been a post doctoral researcher in the crypto group at Aarhus University (Denmark). Elena completed her PhD at Chalmers (Göteborg, Sweden) in 2019. Her motto is: det är lätt att vara efterklok (it’s easy to be wise in hindsight).
