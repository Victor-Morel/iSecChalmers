summary: |-
  Computer systems have evolved beyond classical notions of personal
  computers, servers and even smartphones. They are distributed,
  embedded, capable of learning and can modify our perception of the
  physical world. Securing such systems requires an end-to-end
  perspective. I will demonstrate the utility of this perspective by
  discussing my recent results on: (1) building least-privilege
  distributed systems with applications to the Internet of Things; and
  (2) establishing threat models for systems that learn.

  distributed systems with applications to the Internet of Things; and
  (2) establishing threat models for systems that learn. Specifically,
  I will focus on the class of low-code systems that allow end-users
  to create small automations that connect their digital and physical
  resources. My techniques allow building such automations with least
  privilege. I will also briefly discuss my efforts at devising threat
  models for learning-enabled systems that interact with the physical
  world.

[Earlence Fernandes](http://www.earlence.com/) is an assistant
professor of computer science at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. His goal is to enable society to gain the benefits
of evolved computer systems without the security and privacy
risks. Earlence is a recipient of multiple best paper awards, a
Facebook research award and the NSF CAREER award. He once hacked a
Stop sign, and it is now in a museum.
