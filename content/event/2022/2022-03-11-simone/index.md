abstract: |-
  In this presentation, we present our work, funded by PAPAYA and
  TRUEdig projects, on the suitability of the metaphors for aiding
  informed decisions of data subjects on sharing their data with DP
  systems and discuss open research challenges. Despite the recent
  enhancements in the deployment of differential privacy (DP), little
  research has been conducted addressing the human aspects of
  DP-enabled systems. Metaphors could be a suitable means for
  conveying key protection functionalities of DP to lay users. We
  extracted and generated metaphors for local and central
  differentially private data analysis models. We first analytically
  evaluated the metaphors based on experts’ feedback followed by an
  empirical evaluation via online interviews with 30 participants. The
  results of our interviews show that the metaphorical explanations
  can successfully convey privacy features of DP such as e.g. that
  perturbation protects privacy and that there is a privacy-accuracy
  trade-off. However, conveying information at a high level limits the
  ability to apply and extend the concept to different contexts and
  leads to wrong expectations which negatively affects their
  understanding. Challenges for usable differential privacy and ways
  for approaching them are discussed.
