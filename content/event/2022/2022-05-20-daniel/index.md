summary: |-
  TypeScript is a typed version of JavaScript widely used across
  Amazon, but poses challenges for static analysis: The language
  supports many intricate features used in practice, such as callbacks
  and higher-order functions, dynamic field access, and asynchronous
  code. At the same time, the size of industrial code bases such as
  the Prime Video application makes a highly precise whole-program
  analysis intractable. In this talk, we present how we approach this
  trade-off in Prime Video with a lightweight whole-program analysis
  followed by a more precise goal-directed analysis of potential bug
  locations. Our goal-directed analysis uses an imprecise call graph
  and points-to information generated upfront to guide a more
  expensive goal-directed analysis that attempts to prove that
  potential bugs cannot happen via abstract interpretation backed by
  an SMT solver.

Scientist working in the Amazon Prime Video Automated Reasoning
team. His work is focused on proving properties of TypeScript programs
using an in-house abstract interpretation framework written in
Scala 3. Daniel has a PhD in Computer Science from Chalmers University
