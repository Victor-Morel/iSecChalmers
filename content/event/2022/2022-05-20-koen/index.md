summary: |-
  This talk will be about ongoing work on developing new program
  synthesis techniques. One of the applications is to find programs
  that break type soundness, given a type system and a semantics. I
  will show that some [challenges of the
  IFC](https://ifc-challenge.appspot.com/) can be solved automatically
  in this way.
