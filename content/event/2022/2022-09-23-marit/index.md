summary: |-
  Marit will explain various difficulties of enforcing Art. 25 GDPR from
the perspective of a supervisory authority. She will compare the
deficiencies in this area with the situation of implementing
"security-by-design" approaches. Also, current trends stemming from
technology design and from recent court decisions will be discussed
concerning their relevance for compliance with data protection
requirements. To achieve built-in data protection, Marit will present
her "wish list" that addresses stakeholders such as researchers,
developers, academic teachers, data protection officers, lawyers and the
data protection authorities themselves.

abstract: |-
  During the last few years, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
has changed data processing in Europe and beyond. Unlike previous
legislation concerning data protection, the existence of the GDPR is
known by almost all data controllers, data processors and users. But
when it comes to data protection by design and by default as demanded by
Article 25 GDPR, appropriate system design cannot be taken for granted.
