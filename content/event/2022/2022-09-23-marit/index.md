summary: |-
    Marit will explain various difficulties of enforcing Art. 25 GDPR from the perspective of a supervisory authority. She 
    will compare the deficiencies in this area with the situation of implementing "security-by-design" approaches. Also, 
    current trends stemming from technology design and from recent court decisions will be discussed concerning their 
    relevance for compliance with data protection requirements. To achieve built-in data protection, Marit will present 
    her "wish list" that addresses stakeholders such as researchers, developers, academic teachers, data protection 
    officers, lawyers and the data protection authorities themselves.

abstract: |-
  During the last few years, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has changed data processing in Europe and 
  beyond. Unlike previous legislation concerning data protection, the existence of the GDPR is known by almost all data 
  controllers, data processors and users. But when it comes to data protection by design and by default as demanded by 
  Article 25 GDPR, appropriate system design cannot be taken for granted. Marit will explain various difficulties of 
  enforcing Art. 25 GDPR from the perspective of a supervisory authority. She will compare the deficiencies in this area 
  with the situation of implementing "security-by-design" approaches. Also, current trends stemming from technology design 
  and from recent court decisions will be discussed concerning their relevance for compliance with data protection 
  requirements. To achieve built-in data protection, Marit will present her "wish list" that addresses stakeholders such 
  as researchers, developers, academic teachers, data protection officers, lawyers and the data protection authorities 
  themselves.
