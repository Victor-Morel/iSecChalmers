abstract: |-
  Victor will present in this introductory talk his past work on consent management in the 
  IoT, and his research perspectives for the CyberSecIT project.
The first part of his presentation will summarize his PhD work, including a short video 
demonstration.
 His PhD, conducted in Privatics - the only team dedicated to privacy at Inria - focused 
 on designing a technological solution for information communication and consent 
 management in the IoT addressing legal requirements of the GDPR.
 The second part will introduce his interdisciplinary experience within the Sustainable 
 Computing Lab in Vienna on the standardization of consent in the IoT.
 His short stay at WU Wien was the opportunity to engage with researchers from other 
 disciplines - including law, design, and cognitive science -, and to conduct an 
 exploratory study on cookie paywalls, a novel form of tracking walls.
 Finally, the third part will expose his research perspectives for the CyberSecIT project 
 with the iSec group at Chalmers.
 The CyberSecIT project will tackle the challenges of automation, enabled by software, and 
 autonomy, enabled by machine learning technologies, in IoT systems.
 'Victor will focus more particularly on human factors, addressing research questions such as:' What are the privacy expectations of users in the IoT? Do these expectations differ
 across countries and their respective legal framework?
 The answers brought to these questions by user studies will form the basis for the design 
 of a usable and privacy-friendly permissions system for IoT apps.
