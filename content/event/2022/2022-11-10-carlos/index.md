summary: |-
    In this talk, I will explain how one can leverage definitional interpreters written in Agda (using coinduction and variations of the Delay monad) for proving (suitable versions) of noninterference for security-aware higher-order functional languages with effects. These proofs are, in some sense, simpler than the usual step-indexed logical-relations based proofs that abound in the literature.

abstract: |-
    Definitional interpreters give semantics to programming languages as an evaluation function written in a suitable metalanguage. These interpreters constitute a compelling alternative to relational semantics (e.g., small-step) because they can use used to execute programs, and they are closer to the actual implementation. When the metalanguage is dependently-typed, like Agda or Coq, one can further reason directly about the execution of programs.
