summary: |-
    Felix will introduce PrePaMS, an efficient participation management system that supports prerequisite checks and reward procedures in a privacy-preserving way.
    By using a set of proven cryptographic primitives and mechanisms,
    participations are protected so that service providers and organizers cannot
    derive the identity of participants even within the reward process.

abstract: |-
    Taking part in surveys, experiments, and studies is often compensated by
    rewards to increase the number of participants and encourage attendance.
    While privacy requirements are usually considered for the actual
    participation, privacy aspects of the reward procedure are mostly ignored so
    far. To this end, we introduce PrePaMS, an efficient participation management
    system that supports prerequisite checks and reward procedures in a privacy-
    preserving way.
    Our system organizes participations with potential (dis-)qualifying
    dependencies and enables secure reward payoffs.
    By using a set of proven cryptographic primitives and mechanisms,
    participations are protected so that service providers and organizers cannot
    derive the identity of participants even within the reward process.
    We have designed and implemented a prototype of PrePaMS to show its
    effectiveness and evaluated its applicability in a real use case.
    As PrePaMS does not handle the actual participation events, it is an important
    and valid complement to existing solutions like web-based surveys,
    experiments, and studies to consistently ensure privacy in the overall
    process.
