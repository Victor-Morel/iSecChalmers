title: "Security Properties through the Lens of Modal Logic"


event: Live talk in EDIT 8103

event_url: https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09


summary: |-

  Computer security research is on a long-running quest for a universal framework

  to reason about security properties. Such a framework ought to be expressive

  enough to capture any security policy conceived of, while also being independent

  of syntactic details and enforcement mechanisms, applicable to any system on

  which we may wish to impose security, and intuitive enough that humans can grasp

  the meaning of any given property (and not experience surprises due to a false

  sense of grasping).

  In this talk, I will present a framework based on modal logic

  which we have recently introduced in pursuit of these goals.

  In our approach, we combine established techniques for modal reasoning about

  knowledge with modalities of time and possible actions, and carefully distinguish

  between agents' capabilities and the effects we wish to permit them to achieve.

  

  As we show, our formalism can be used to represent various progress- and termination-(in)sensitive

  variants of confidentiality, integrity, robust declassification and

  transparent endorsement, for each of which we have proven equivalence to standard definitions.

  The intuitive nature and closeness to semantic reality

  of our approach allows us to make explicit

  several hidden assumptions of these definitions, and identify potential

  issues and subtleties with them, while also holding the promise

  of formulating cleaner versions and future extension to entirely novel properties.

  

  This project is joint work with Musard Balliu and Roberto Guanciale at KTH.

Matvey Soloviev is a postdoc at KTH working under Musard Balliu.

Previously, he obtained a Ph.D. at Cornell University under

the supervision of Joseph Y. Halpern. The focus of his research is in developing

formal approaches to program security by borrowing insights from fields such as

logic, analytic philosophy and game theory.
