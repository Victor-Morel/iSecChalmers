title: "Provably Sound Static Analysis for Ethereum Smart Contracts"


event: Live talk in EDIT 8103

event_url: https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09


summary: |-

  Smart contracts are distributed applications, which govern financial assets in cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and, hence, can implement advanced financial instruments, such as decentralized exchanges or autonomous organizations (DAOs). In this talk, I will overview our advances in developing static analyzers that come with provable guarantees. I will first show how to define generic security properties that characterize the absence of prominent attack classes (such as reentrancy or transaction order dependence) and then discuss different forms of static analysis that can prove these properties and that can be efficiently implemented to analyze real-world smart contracts.


abstract: |-

  Smart contracts are distributed applications, which 
  govern financial assets in cryptocurrencies such as 
  Ethereum and, hence, can implement advanced financial 
  instruments, such as decentralized exchanges or 
  autonomous organizations (DAOs). 

  Their financial nature makes smart contracts an 
  attractive attack target, as demonstrated by numerous 
  exploits on popular contracts resulting in financial 
  damage of millions of dollars. 

  This omnipresent attack hazard motivates the need for 
  sound static analysis tools, which assist smart 
  contract developers in eliminating contract 
  vulnerabilities a priori to deployment. 

  In this talk, I will overview our advances in 
  developing static analyzers that come with provable 
  guarantees. 
  
  I will first show how to define generic security 
  properties that characterize the absence of prominent 
  attack classes (such as reentrancy or transaction 
  order dependence) and then discuss different forms of 
  static analysis that can prove these properties and 
  that can be efficiently implemented to analyze 
  real-world smart contracts.
