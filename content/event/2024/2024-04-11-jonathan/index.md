title: "Adoption and Implementation of QNAME Minimization in DNS"


event: Live talk in EDIT 8103

event_url: https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09


summary: |-

  The presentation delves into the critical aspects of QNAME Minimization within

  the DNS, presenting an in-depth analysis through two key studies. The first

  segment, "Adoption of QNAME Minimization," presents the main takeaways from "A

  Second Look at QNAME Minimization" (PAM, 2023). This study provides insights

  into how QNAME Minimization has been embraced across different platforms and

  its implications for privacy and performance in DNS lookups.  The second

  segment, "Implementation of QNAME Minimization," introduces new research on

  fingerprinting DNS resolvers by leveraging the query patterns emerging from

  QNAME Minimization. This study, currently under submission, aims to shed light

  on the plethora of implementation approaches to minimizing queries and how

  these differences can be used to fingerprint resolver software and versions.

  Through these studies, the presentation aims to foster a deeper understanding

  of DNS resolver dynamics, highlighting the importance of QNAME Minimization in

  bolstering DNS privacy.
