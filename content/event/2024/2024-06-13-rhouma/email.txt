Abstract:
Cryptography, data Hiding and digital watermarking algorithms being the basic building blocks for making powerful security solutions and security and privacy protocols. The systems at each end must negotiate and establish the configuration of these basic algorithms and their parameters before secure communication can occur. I will describe my research on the design of different types of cryptographic algorithms aimed at some application domains which will span everything from crypto-compression techniques and new image cryptosystems to lightweight cryptographic primitives for resource-restrained devices. One of the main objectives will be to provide a formal verification of these algorithms regarding their statistical, differential, and linear cryptanalysis, to verify their claims of security proof.  In addition to standard cryptography, we might look at new ways to support confidentiality, e.g., data hiding in digital images.  I will be talking about blind steganalysis methods using machine learning/deep learning methods which can be used in targeted attacks to break or assess the security of these data hiding systems. I will also illustrate the significant value that a rigorous cryptanalysis / security evaluation plays in the comprehensive design of what the critical security and privacy constructs. These techniques combine domain knowledge and cryptographic algorithms to secure the way in which sensitive data can be integrated. This analysis may provide an understanding of what types of algorithms can be better to use based on their cryptanalysis work.
