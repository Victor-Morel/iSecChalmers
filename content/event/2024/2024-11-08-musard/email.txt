Title:
Code-reuse attacks in JavaScript-driven applications


When:
November 08, 2024 13:15-14:15


Where:
in EDIT 6217
and over Zoom [https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09]


Abstract:
The last decade has seen a proliferation of code-reuse attacks in the context of web applications. These attacks target vulnerabilities in which attacker-controlled data exploits legitimate code fragments within the application’s codebase to execute a code chain that performs malicious computations, e.g. Remote Code Execution, on the attacker’s behalf. In this talk, we will discuss how principled large-scale static and dynamic code analysis helps in discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in high-profile server-side applications and their software supply chain, as well as existing defensive mechanisms.
