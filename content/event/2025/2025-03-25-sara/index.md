title: "Rethinking Privacy with Pointwise Maximal Leakage"

event: Live talk in EDIT 8103

summary: |-

  In this talk, I will discuss the problem of privacy-preserving statistical analysis. I will start with an introduction to _differential privacy_, a key framework in this area. Then, I will present _pointwise maximal leakage_ (PML), a privacy measure that I developed during my PhD studies. PML quantifies the amount of information leaking about a secret when releasing the outcome of a randomized function calculated on the secret. I will draw connections between PML and differential privacy while also highlighting their differences. Additionally, I will discuss an application where private information is sanitized while guaranteeing privacy in the sense of PML. Finally, I will explore open questions, current, and future research directions.
