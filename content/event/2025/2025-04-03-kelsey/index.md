title: "A Two-Round, Ideally Secure, Strong Asymmetric PAKE"


event: Live talk in EDIT 8103

event_url: https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09


summary: |-

  Strong Asymmetric Password-Authenticated Key Exchange (saPAKE) enables a client, holding only a low-entropy password, to repeatedly establish shared high-entropy session keys with a server, holding a digest of that password. Ideally, an adversary is limited to impersonation attempts, online dictionary attacks, and, in the event of a leaked digest, a brute-force attack that does not admit precomputation. In this talk, I will present our novel saPAKE protocol, which is the first to simultaneously achieve the ideal security, as described, in a single round trip without generic algebraic models. We instantiate our saPAKE from an oblivious pseudorandom function (OPRF); I will also present our novel Dodis-Yampolskiy-based OPRF, the first online-extractable and input-committing UC-secure OPRF.
