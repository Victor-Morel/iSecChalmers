title: "Enforcing Privacy Requirements at Meta: A summary and Key Learnings"


event: Live talk in HB3

event_url: https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09


summary: |-

  Enforcing Privacy Requirements at scale is a challenging task. In this talk we will go over key learnings on this space, using the more familiar domain of Security to draw analogies and highlight differences. The talk covers four key learnings: (a) the key similarities and distinctions between security and privacy requirements, (b) how to design an effective enforcement framework, (c) how to get such an enforcement framework deployed at scale, and (d), the main approaches for demonstrating the effectiveness of such enforcement to relevant parties. Overall, the talk will emphasize a proactive and comprehensive approach to enforcing privacy requirements.
