title: "Post-quantum Signal, deniable authentication against malicious verifiers, and BUFFing signatures"


event: Live talk in EDIT 8103

event_url: https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09


summary: |-

  In this talk, Rune gives an overview of his research so far. 
  The first part of the talk covers Signal's initial handshake protocol and transitioning to a post-quantum protocol. 
  He has proposed a post-quantum replacement protocol called SPQR [PKC:BFGJS22] and analyzed the confidentiality [PKC:FieGun25] and deniability [PoPETS:FieJan24] of PQXDH, the post-quantum protocol that Signal has deployed for the initial handshake.
  In the second part he presents his (impossibility) results on deniable authentication against malicious verifiers and the implications for Signal's initial handshake. [EPRINT:FieLan25] 
  In the third part he introduces the Beyond UnForgeability Features (BUFF) for signature schemes [SP:CDFFJ21] and gives an overview how the signature schemes in the NIST standardization process are doing wrt. BUFF properties [SAC:DuzFieFis24].
