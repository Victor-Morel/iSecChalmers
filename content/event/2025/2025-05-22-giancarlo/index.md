title: 'YuraScanner: An Autonomous Web Application Scanner'
event: Live talk in EDIT 8103
event_url: https://chalmers.zoom.us/j/65786317139?pwd=U1FlMks3THpNNG1WaFRJNkJxQXdBQT09
summary: |
  Web applications are evolving at an unprecedented pace, introducing new features that often come with new vulnerabilities. Relying solely on developers to identify these issues is no longer sustainable, highlighting the urgent need for automated tools to support the security process. Web application scanning is arguably the flagship testing technique capable of taking on this responsibility, yet significant challenges remain to achieve full automation.

  In this talk, we briefly review the current state of web application scanning and outline its key challenges and limitations. We then introduce YuraScanner, one of the first autonomous, task-driven web scanners. YuraScanner approaches attack surface discovery as a goal-oriented agent: it dynamically generates testing objectives and executes actions to navigate complex web application workflows with no human intervention. Unlike traditional scanners, it leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret and reason about the application’s state and behavior, enabling broad adaptability across diverse web applications. Our evaluation across 20 popular web applications demonstrates that YuraScanner uncovers deeper attack surfaces and identifies more XSS vulnerabilities than conventional tools.

Giancarlo Pellegrino is a faculty at CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security, where he leads the application security research group. Previously, he was a visiting asst professor at Stanford University as the first member of the CISPA-Stanford Center for Cybersecurity. Giancarlo earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Eurecom. His research primarily focuses on identifying, analyzing, and addressing vulnerabilities in web applications, both at the application and platform levels, developing testing tools that can operate at scale. Giancarlo served as a PC member for the major security venues (e.g., IEEE SP, CCS, and USENIX Security), as an area chair (USENIX Security 22-23), and is currently serving as a PC co-chair for USENIX Security 2025.
