summary: "Blockchains promise trust without intermediaries - but only if their security assumptions hold. \nTo push throughput from tens to thousands of transactions per second, the industry and market now leans towards Layer 2 (L2) solutions such as Payment Channel Networks, Optimistic Rollups, Zero-Knowledge Rollups, Validium and Volition.\n\nThis talk presents a concise tour of the first comprehensive taxonomy of those assumptions.\n"
abstract: "Blockchains promise trust without intermediaries - but only if their security assumptions hold. \nTo push throughput from tens to thousands of transactions per second, the industry and market now leans towards Layer 2 (L2) solutions such as Payment Channel Networks, Optimistic Rollups, Zero-Knowledge Rollups, Validium and Volition.\nEach provide with scalability, yet each quietly adds new security assumptions and/or trust assumptions.\n\nThis talk presents a concise tour of the first comprehensive taxonomy of those assumptions. In particular, we will:\n\n1. Revisit the baseline security assumptions of permissionless Layer 1 Blockchains.\n2. Review the inherited and additional security assumptions that Layer 2 Scaling Solutions put on top of the baseline ones.\n3. Compare how different L2 designs trade censorship-resistance, data availability and decentralisation for scalability.\n4. Offer a number of insights that practitioners can use to evaluate whether an L2’s threat model matches their risk tolerance.\n\nAttendees will leave with a sharper understanding of the hidden costs of “scaling solutions”, the questions to ask before integrating or investing, and a roadmap for research directions that could reclaim security without sacrificing performance.\n"

Adrià Torralba-Agell is a PhD Student at the [K-riptography and Information Security for Open Networks (KISON) research group](https://recerca.uoc.edu/grupos/37397/detalle?lang=en) at Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC), doing a Research Stay at Chalmers University of Technology at [SecuraLab Research Group](https://securalab.org/). 
He holds a Double BSc on Mathematics and Computer Science by the Universitat de Barcelona (UB) and also has a MSc on Fundamental Principles of Data Science by UB.

His research interests are on Cryptography and Blockchain. In particular, he is interested on blockchain security assumptions, and on the use of Zero-Knowledge Proofs to scale blockchains.
