We then introduce YuraScanner, one of the first autonomous, task-driven web scanners. YuraScanner approaches attack surface discovery as a goal-oriented agent: it dynamically generates testing objectives and executes actions to navigate complex web application workflows with no human intervention. Unlike traditional scanners, it leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret and reason about the application’s state and behavior, enabling broad adaptability across diverse web applications. Our evaluation across 20 popular web applications demonstrates that YuraScanner uncovers deeper attack surfaces and identifies more XSS vulnerabilities than conventional tools.</p></div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>May 22, 2025 2:00 PM &mdash; 3:00 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Giancarlo Pellegrino</p></div></div></div><div class=ml-3><a href=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-05-22-giancarlo/><img src=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-05-22-giancarlo/featured_huba6f4ed3b6818c324056125563564482_30221_150x0_resize_q75_lanczos.jpg alt="YuraScanner: An Autonomous Web Application Scanner" loading=lazy></a></div></div><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-05-20-rune/>Post-quantum Signal, deniable authentication against malicious verifiers, and BUFFing signatures</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-05-20-rune/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style><p>In this talk, Rune gives an overview of his research so far.

Our approach to enforcing restrictions on data involves using annotations to represent different aspects of data and its processing and using these annotations to apply policy checks across data flows. Equipped with privacy-relevant annotations, we show how Policy Zones enforces high-level data restrictions across two paradigms that, together, encompass the common lifecycle of data: general-purpose programming languages where the data is initially collected, and data warehouse systems where the data is processed in batch.</p><p>There are several challenges in designing Policy Zones, including: translating high-level privacy restrictions to code; handling different data granularities to avoid label creep; maintaining homogeneity of data annotations across heterogeneous data processing systems; managing reclassification in practice; and the scale of applying this tech to large companies such as Meta.</p></div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>May 14, 2025 2:15 PM &mdash; 3:00 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Lucas Waye</p></div></div></div><div class=ml-3><a href=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-05-14-lucas/><img src=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-05-14-lucas/featured_hub802492e02068040eb6ca70a6d3c48d0_504144_150x0_resize_lanczos_2.png alt="Policy Zones: Information-Flow Control at Meta" loading=lazy></a></div></div><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-05-14-yiannis/>Enforcing Privacy Requirements at Meta: A summary and Key Learnings</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-05-14-yiannis/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style>Enforcing Privacy Requirements at scale is a challenging task.

Using k-d tree search and time series methods, it achieves 99.5% accuracy, even under VPNs or Wi-Fi eavesdropping. To address the privacy risks, we analyze the vulnerability&rsquo;s root causes, propose mitigations, and provide open-source tools and datasets for the community.</div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>Jan 22, 2025 1:00 PM &mdash; 2:00 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Martin Björklund</p></div></div></div><div class=ml-3><a href=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-01-22-martin/><img src=/research/group/security/event/2025/2025-01-22-martin/featured_hu08a788bbb2be224023e40fd587786fcc_4504_150x0_resize_q75_lanczos.jpeg alt="Endangered Privacy: Large-Scale Monitoring of Video Streaming Services" loading=lazy></a></div></div></div></div><div class=row id=talk_list><div class=col-lg-2><h3>2024</h3></div><div class=col-lg-10><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-12-05-mojtaba/>TAPShield: Securing Trigger-Action Platforms against Strong Attackers</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-12-05-mojtaba/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style><p>Automation apps enable seamless connection of IoT devices and services to provide useful functionality for end-users.

An escrow encrypts the evaluation of a function P(t,x), where t is a secret input used to generate the auditor&rsquo;s key and x is the user&rsquo;s private input to escrow generation. Nothing but P(t,x) is revealed even to a fully corrupted auditor. The original definition and construction (Kohlweiss et al., EUROCRYPT'23) only support the evaluation of functions on an input x provided by a single user.</p><p>We address this limitation by introducing updatable privacy-preserving blueprint schemes (UPPB), which enhance the original notion with the ability for multiple parties to non-interactively update the private value x in a blueprint. Moreover, a UPPB scheme allows for verifying that a blueprint is the result of a sequence of valid updates while revealing nothing else.</p><p>We present uBlu, an efficient instantiation of UPPB for computing a comparison between private user values and a private threshold t set by the auditor, where the current value x is the cumulative sum of private inputs, which enables applications such as privacy-preserving anti-money laundering and location tracking. Additionally, we show the feasibility of the notion generically for all value update functions and (binary) predicates from FHE and NIZKs.</p><p>Our main technical contribution is a technique to keep the size of primary blueprint components independent of the number of updates and reasonable for practical applications. This is achieved by elegantly extending an algebraic NIZK by Couteau and Hartmann (CRYPTO'20) with an update function and making it compatible with our additive updates. This result is of independent interest and may find additional applications thanks to the concise size of our proofs.</p></div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>Nov 14, 2024 1:15 PM &mdash; 2:15 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Mikhail Volkhov</p></div></div></div><div class=ml-3><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-11-14-mikhail/><img src=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-11-14-mikhail/featured_hu50af8f5ce7d7b82f777f316aca3ca464_5898427_150x0_resize_q75_lanczos.jpg alt="Updatable Privacy-Preserving Blueprints" loading=lazy></a></div></div><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-11-08-musard/>Code-reuse attacks in JavaScript-driven applications</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-11-08-musard/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style>The last decade has seen a proliferation of code-reuse attacks in the context of web applications.

Nevertheless, current processes, mainly through filling forms are still based on practices that lead to over-collection. Indeed, any citizen wishing to apply for a benefit (or service) will transmit all their personal data involved in the evaluation of the eligibility criteria. The resulting problem of over-collection affects millions of individuals, with considerable volumes of information collected. If this problem of compliance concerns both public and private organizations (e.g., social services, banks, insurance companies), it is because it faces non-trivial issues, which hinder the implementation of data minimization by developers. In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach that enables data minimization and informed choices for the users, for any decision problem modeled using classical logic, which covers a wide range of practical cases. Our data minimization solution uses game theoretic notions to explain and quantify the privacy payoff for the user. We show how our algorithms can be applied to practical cases study as a new PET for minimal, fully accurate (all due services must be preserved) and informed data collection.

More interestingly, semantic IRs provide a basis for numerous avenues of future work on the principled design of language interoperability: how to support the inclusion of libraries whose behavior is foreign to the original language, how to prove soundness and security properties that are robust to behaviors (attackers) outside of the semantic IR, and how to develop a compiler IRs and backends that makes it easier to implement and verify sound interoperability for a wide array of source languages.</div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>Mar 25, 2024 1:15 PM &mdash; 2:15 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Amal Ahmed</p></div></div></div><div class=ml-3><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2024-03-25-amal/><img src=/research/group/security/event/2023/2024-03-25-amal/featured_hu3b26cb84cddba6ce485d3f67769a7aa3_463064_150x0_resize_q75_lanczos.jpg alt="Semantic Intermediate Representations for Sound Language Interoperability" loading=lazy></a></div></div><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2024-03-13-earlance/>Experimental Analyses of the Physical Surveillance Risks in Client-side Content Scanning</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2024-03-13-earlance/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style>Content scanning systems employ perceptual hashing algorithms to scan user content for illicit material, such as child pornography or terrorist recruitment flyers. Perceptual hashing algorithms help determine whether two images are visually similar while preserving the privacy of the input images. Several efforts from industry and academia propose scanning on client devices such as smartphones due to the impending rollout of end-to-end encryption that will make server-side scanning difficult. These proposals have met with strong criticism because of the potential for the technology to be misused for censorship. However, the risks of this technology in the context of surveillance are not well understood. This talk will discuss results from our experimental investigation of physical surveillance risks in these systems. Concretely: (1) we offer a definition of physical surveillance in the context of client-side image scanning systems; (2) we experimentally characterize this risk; (3) we experimentally study the trade-off between the robustness of client-side image scanning systems and surveillance, showing that more robust detection of illicit material leads to an increased potential for physical surveillance in most settings.</div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>Mar 13, 2024 1:30 PM &mdash; 2:30 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Earlence Fernandes</p></div></div></div><div class=ml-3><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2024-03-13-earlance/><img src=/research/group/security/event/2023/2024-03-13-earlance/featured_hu485e36a1c0a935bfef0efc45b108b135_3241886_150x0_resize_q75_lanczos.jpg alt="Experimental Analyses of the Physical Surveillance Risks in Client-side Content Scanning" loading=lazy></a></div></div><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2024-03-11-mohannad/>Attack Surface Management in Modern Software Systems</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2024-03-11-mohannad/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style>Modern computer systems, encompassing mobile, cyber-physical, and cloud applications, are evolving to become more interconnected and complex.

In this talk, I will review underlying mechanisms and main principles behind deep learning when applied to offensive and defensive cybersecurity solutions. I will focus on two primary use cases: traffic analysis attacks on Tor and network-based intrusion detection systems, analyzing the expected benefits and potential pitfalls of using deep learning. This analysis effectively challenges the common perception of a purely end-to-end approach. To that end, the presentation emphasizes the importance of explainability and error analysis for validating and troubleshooting deep neural networks.

However, these optimizations also enable attacks that undermine software-enforced security policies. The conventional approach of constant-time programming, while widely adopted for safeguarding cryptographic implementations against microarchitectural attacks, has its limitations. From a security perspective, it relies on certain assumptions about the underlying hardware and, for instance, does not suffice to protect against Spectre attacks. In terms of performance, it imposes an additional overhead due to, among other things, control-flow linearization.</p><p>In this presentation, we introduce two novel hardware-software co-design solutions to address some of the shortcomings of constant-time programming. First, we present ProSpeCT, a generic formal processor model that guarantees that constant-time programs (under a non-speculative semantics) are free from Spectre attacks, while still enabling speculative out-of-order execution. Second, Architectural Mimicry, a novel ISA extension that provides dedicated hardware support for efficient control-flow balancing and linearization of secret-dependent branches. Both defenses have been implemented and evaluated on top of Proteus, an extensible RISC-V processor. To conclude, we will discuss some of the remaining challenges that still need to be addressed to achieve provable end-to-end security guarantees.</p></div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>Nov 20, 2023 1:15 PM &mdash; 2:15 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Lesly-Ann Daniel</p></div></div></div><div class=ml-3><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2023-11-20-lesly-ann/><img src=/research/group/security/event/2023/2023-11-20-lesly-ann/featured_hu1bd20ba042c3b8f78837e7ea453b14ae_286716_150x0_resize_q75_lanczos.jpg alt="Hardware-software co-designs for microarchitectural security beyond constant-time programming" loading=lazy></a></div></div><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2023-11-13-yuki/>Integrating Side Channel Security into the High Level Synthesis based Design Flow</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2023-11-13-yuki/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style>In the Internet of Things era, edge devices have been considerably diversified and are often designed using high level synthesis (HLS), which translates behavioral descriptions into hardware descriptions, for improved design productivity.

We conclude by using string diagrams to rederive the security of the one-time pad and no-go results concerning the limits of bipartite and tripartite cryptography, ruling out e.g., composable commitments and broadcasting.</div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>Mar 13, 2023 3:15 PM &mdash; 4:15 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Martti Karvonen</p></div></div><div class=btn-links><a class="btn btn-outline-primary btn-page-header btn-sm" href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2023-03-13-martti/2023-03-13-martti.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener>PDF</a></div></div><div class=ml-3><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2023-03-13-martti/><img src=/research/group/security/event/2023/2023-03-13-martti/featured_hu25d333fcded103db2f52f7476cb1420a_335251_150x0_resize_q75_lanczos.jpg alt="Categorical Composable Cryptography" loading=lazy></a></div></div><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2023-03-09-yash/>Composable Non-interactive Zero-knowledge Proofs in the Random Oracle Model</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2023/2023-03-09-yash/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style>In this talk, I will give an overview of techniques to compile Sigma protocols—a popular class of interactive cryptographic proofs—to non-interactive proofs that guarantee security when used in any larger protocol context.

Thus, for the last decade, designing systems to analyze mobile apps for vulnerabilities or unwanted behavior has been a major research focus within the security community. Leveraging the lessons and techniques learned from mobile app analysis, researchers have developed similar systems to evaluate the security, safety, and privacy of smart homes by inspecting IoT apps developed for platforms such as SmartThings. However, emerging characteristics of smart home ecosystems indicate the need to move away from the approach of IoT app analysis, as IoT apps may not be representative of the home automation in real homes, and moreover, be unavailable for analysis or instrumentation in the near future.</div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>Dec 10, 2021 1:15 PM &mdash; 2:15 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Adwait Nadkarni</p></div></div></div><div class=ml-3></div></div><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2021/2021-12-03/>Retrofitting Impure Languages with Static Information-Flow Control</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2021/2021-12-03/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style>How can we write secure programs in a pervasively effectful language?

In an impure language, such as ML, however, a function of type Int -> Int may read, write, or even order a burrito. It’s impossible to assert that a function is secure from its type alone, since it may be performing invisible side effects that may leak a secret.</div></a><div class="stream-meta article-metadata"><div><span>Dec 3, 2021 1:15 PM &mdash; 2:15 PM</span></div><div><p style=font-size:17px>Nachiappan Valliappan</p></div></div></div><div class=ml-3></div></div><div class="media stream-item"><div class=media-body><div class="section-subheading article-title mb-0 mt-0"><a href=/research/group/security/event/2021/2021-11-19-gerardo/>Is Privacy by Construction Possible?</a></div><a href=/research/group/security/event/2021/2021-11-19-gerardo/ class=summary-link><div class=article-style>Finding suitable ways to handle personal data in conformance with the law is challenging.
