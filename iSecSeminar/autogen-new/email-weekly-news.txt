Title:
Scaling at a (Security) Cost: Unveiling the Security Assumptions Behind Todayâ€™s Blockchain Layer 2 Scaling Solutions

When:
Jun 12, 2025 13:15-14:15

Where:
in EDIT 8103

Summary:
Blockchains promise trust without intermediariesâ€”but only if their security assumptions hold.
To push throughput from tens to thousands of transactions per second, the industry and market now leans towards Layer 2 (L2) solutions such as Payment Channel Networks, Optimistic Rollups, Zero-Knowledge Rollups, Validium and Volition.
This talk presents a concise tour of the first comprehensive taxonomy of those assumptions.
