# Tip: Use YAML's multiline strings for long texts like abstract and bio.
# The text needs to be indented, but YAML will trim the indentation.
# e.g.
# abstract: |
#   Line of text 1.
#   Line of text 2.
#
#   Line of text 3.

# The abstract and bio will be pasted as-is into `index.md`, so Markdown formatting is supported.
# The *-short versions are used for the Weekly News email, and abstract-short will be used for the event summary.
