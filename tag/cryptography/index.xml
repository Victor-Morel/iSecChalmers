She earned her doctorate in computer science from University of Edinburgh in 1987, and has a background in programming language semantics and functional programming. But in recent years her focus has been on security, mainly using the EasyCrypt proof assistant to prove the security of cryptographic protocols.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>LogPicker: Strengthening Certificate Transparency Against Covert Adversaries</title><link>https://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/security/event/2022/2022-03-04-alexandra/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2022 13:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/security/event/2022/2022-03-04-alexandra/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ias/staff/alexandra-dirksen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alexandra Dirksen&lt;/a>
is a PhD Candidate at &lt;a href="https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TU Braunschweig&lt;/a>
and is currently working in the field of Web Security &amp;amp; Privacy, Web
PKI and Large Scale Adversaries. Her further interests are different
topics of Applied Cryptography and Ethics in Computer Science. She is
currently part of the &lt;a href="https://kiwi-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KIWI Project&lt;/a>, where
she works on mechanisms to detect security issues in OAuth protocol
flows at runtime.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On Progressive and Efficient Verification of Digital Signatures</title><link>https://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/security/event/2022/2022-02-04-elena/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 13:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/security/event/2022/2022-02-04-elena/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://epagnin.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elena Pagnin&lt;/a> is currently an assistant professor at Lund University (Sweden). Here she is an active member of the CRYSPY lab (CRYptography Security and PrivacY). Her research is focused on cryptography and security, with a special interest for homomorphic cryptosystems, data authentication and user privacy. Prior to joining Lund University, Elena has been a post doctoral researcher in the crypto group at Aarhus University (Denmark). Elena completed her PhD at Chalmers (Göteborg, Sweden) in 2019. Her motto is: det är lätt att vara efterklok (it’s easy to be wise in hindsight).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High-Assurance Cryptography Software in the Spectre Era</title><link>https://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/security/event/2021/2021-06-11-css-talk44/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 13:15:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/security/event/2021/2021-06-11-css-talk44/</guid><description>&lt;p>To appear in the Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and
