These apps are typically executed on cloud-based Trigger-Action Platforms(TAPs) such as IFTTT and Node-RED, supporting both single- and multi-tenant architectures. These architectures raise security and privacy concerns in the face of cloud attackers and malicious app makers, resulting in massive exfiltration of sensitive user data.
To address these concerns, we design TAPShield, an architecture that uses confidential computing and language-level sandboxing to protect users’ sensitive information against untrustworthy TAPs and malicious apps. TAPShield targets JavaScript-driven TAPs built on the Node.js environment and uses trusted execution environments via Intel SGX to protect against cloud attackers. It further uses language-level sandboxes such as vm2 and SandTrap to protect against malicious apps. We implement TAPShield for two popular TAPs, Node-RED and IFTTT, and report on the security, performance, and compatibility trade-offs on a range of real-world apps.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-11-14-mikhail/>Updatable Privacy-Preserving Blueprints</a></h2><div class=article-style>Privacy-preserving blueprints enable users to create escrows using the auditor's public key. An escrow encrypts the evaluation of a function P(t,x), where t is a secret input used to generate the auditor's key and x is the user's private input to escrow generation. Nothing but P(t,x) is revealed even to a fully corrupted auditor. The original definition and construction (Kohlweiss et al., EUROCRYPT'23) only support the evaluation of functions on an input x provided by a single user.
We address this limitation by introducing updatable privacy-preserving blueprint schemes (UPPB), which enhance the original notion with the ability for multiple parties to non-interactively update the private value x in a blueprint. Moreover, a UPPB scheme allows for verifying that a blueprint is the result of a sequence of valid updates while revealing nothing else.
We present uBlu, an efficient instantiation of UPPB for computing a comparison between private user values and a private threshold t set by the auditor, where the current value x is the cumulative sum of private inputs, which enables applications such as privacy-preserving anti-money laundering and location tracking. Additionally, we show the feasibility of the notion generically for all value update functions and (binary) predicates from FHE and NIZKs.
Our main technical contribution is a technique to keep the size of primary blueprint components independent of the number of updates and reasonable for practical applications. This is achieved by elegantly extending an algebraic NIZK by Couteau and Hartmann (CRYPTO'20) with an update function and making it compatible with our additive updates. This result is of independent interest and may find additional applications thanks to the concise size of our proofs.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-11-08-musard/>Code-reuse attacks in JavaScript-driven applications</a></h2><div class=article-style>The last decade has seen a proliferation of code-reuse attacks in the context of web applications. These attacks target vulnerabilities in which attacker-controlled data exploits legitimate code fragments within the application’s codebase to execute a code chain that performs malicious computations, e.g. Remote Code Execution, on the attacker’s behalf. In this talk, we will discuss how principled large-scale static and dynamic code analysis helps in discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in high-profile server-side applications and their software supply chain, as well as existing defensive mechanisms.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-10-17-lucia/>Consistency-or-Die: Consistency for Key Transparency</a></h2><div class=article-style>In this seminar I will present the paper that lies the foundation for the phd position I applied to. Key Transparency Log are an emerging technique to provide a secure and transparent way to manage and distribute cryptographic keys in centralised systems such as WhatsApp and iMessage. This paper (by Brorsson et al) presents a new way to prevent split-view attacks in Key Transparency Logs by leveraging light-weight and scalable cryptographic tools.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-09-19-elena/>CaSCaDE: (Time-Based) Cryptography from Space Communications DElay</a></h2><div class=article-style>In a world where cryptographic constructs are stuck in a race against faster algorithms, we propose a cosmic solution: why not root cryptographic provable delays in the speed of light? This paper introduces Sequential Communication Delay (SCD) in the Universal Composability framework, a functionality models communication channels where data is transmitted fashionably late. With our SCD proofs, we proposed the first constructions of a Verifiable Delay Function and a Publicly Verifiable Time-Lock Puzzle that do not rely on computational assumptions Say goodbye to the worries of computational speed-ups and hello to a time-delay rooted in the cosmos!</div></div><div><h2><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-08-30-benjamin/>Data Collection via Forms with Data Minimization, Full Accuracy and Informed Consent</a></h2><div class=article-style>The advent of privacy laws and principles such as data minimization and informed consent are supposed to protect citizens from over-collection of personal data. Nevertheless, current processes, mainly through filling forms are still based on practices that lead to over-collection. Indeed, any citizen wishing to apply for a benefit (or service) will transmit all their personal data involved in the evaluation of the eligibility criteria. The resulting problem of over-collection affects millions of individuals, with considerable volumes of information collected. If this problem of compliance concerns both public and private organizations (e.g., social services, banks, insurance companies), it is because it faces non-trivial issues, which hinder the implementation of data minimization by developers. In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach that enables data minimization and informed choices for the users, for any decision problem modeled using classical logic, which covers a wide range of practical cases. Our data minimization solution uses game theoretic notions to explain and quantify the privacy payoff for the user. We show how our algorithms can be applied to practical cases study as a new PET for minimal, fully accurate (all due services must be preserved) and informed data collection. If time permits, we will perform a short demonstration of our prototype system.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-08-22-steven/>Re-designing computer systems for reliable electronic evidence</a></h2><div class=article-style>Computer systems are increasingly relied upon for a wide range of important tasks, but much of the research on reliability has been restricted to the control systems for safety-critical hardware. For other systems, efforts to assess their effectiveness has been more ad-hoc and of questionable validity, even those relied upon to produce legally admissible evidence. From breathalyzers and forensic software to the infamous Post Office Horizon system, computer bugs can make the difference between someone being imprisoned and going free. This talk will discuss some examples of computer evidence failures risking causing miscarriages of justice, and what can be done to mitigate such risks in the future. In particular, it will motivate the idea that computer systems relied upon for computer evidence should be built with rigorous engineering techniques, but that these techniques are distinct from what are needed for safety-critical systems. When combined with appropriate treatment by the legal system, we can help avoid future miscarriages of justice.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-06-13-rhouma/>Analysis and Design of cryptographic and data hiding algorithms</a></h2><div class=article-style>Cryptography, data Hiding and digital watermarking algorithms being the basic building blocks for making powerful security solutions and security and privacy protocols. The systems at each end must negotiate and establish the configuration of these basic algorithms and their parameters before secure communication can occur. I will describe my research on the design of different types of cryptographic algorithms aimed at some application domains which will span everything from crypto-compression techniques and new image cryptosystems to lightweight cryptographic primitives for resource-restrained devices. One of the main objectives will be to provide a formal verification of these algorithms regarding their statistical, differential, and linear cryptanalysis, to verify their claims of security proof. In addition to standard cryptography, we might look at new ways to support confidentiality, e.g., data hiding in digital images. I will be talking about blind steganalysis methods using machine learning/deep learning methods which can be used in targeted attacks to break or assess the security of these data hiding systems. I will also illustrate the significant value that a rigorous cryptanalysis / security evaluation plays in the comprehensive design of what the critical security and privacy constructs. These techniques combine domain knowledge and cryptographic algorithms to secure the way in which sensitive data can be integrated. This analysis may provide an understanding of what types of algorithms can be better to use based on their cryptanalysis work.</div></div><div><h2><a href=/research/group/security/event/2024/2024-06-12-alex/>A verified WebAssembly interpreter in Lean</a></h2><div class=article-style>WebAssembly is a new low-level programming language designed with the goal to increase interoperability and security across the software ecosystem. The WebAssembly specification is defined by the World Wide Web Consortium, with a multitude of implementors, ranging from browsers to standalone runtimes.
In order to ensure adherence to the specification, some WebAssembly implementations use formally-verified interpreters as testing oracles. This thesis explores a novel approach to designing a formally-verified interpreter, by using an intrinsically-typed representation of the WebAssembly syntax.
This intrinsically-typed interpreter is implemented in the Lean 4 proof assistant, leveraging its functional-but-in-place features to achieve good performance without sacrificing functional purity.</div></div><nav><ul class="pagination justify-content-center"><li class=page-item><a class=page-link href=/research/group/security/tag/csstalk/page/2/>&#187;</a></li></ul></nav></div></div><div class=page-footer><div class=container><footer class=site-footer></footer></div></div><div id=modal class="modal fade" role=dialog><div class=modal-dialog><div class=modal-content><div class=modal-header><h5 class=modal-title>Cite</h5><button type=button class=close data-dismiss=modal aria-label=Close>
