She holds bachelor&amp;rsquo;s and master&amp;rsquo;s degrees in information security and a PhD in computer science from Ruhr University Bochum, as well as a law degree from the University of Bayreuth. Her doctoral research concerned effects of the GDPR on third-party web tracking and was conducted within the framework of an interdisciplinary graduate school, SecHuman - Security for People in Cyberspace. She combines online measurements with methods from human-computer interaction to foster people&amp;rsquo;s awareness and agency regarding the processing of their personal data. Her work was published at leading venues for security &amp;amp; privacy and human-computer interaction and was repeatedly featured at the FTC PrivacyCon in Washington, DC.&lt;/p>
