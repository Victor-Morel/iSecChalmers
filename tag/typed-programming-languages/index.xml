Her interests include type systems and semantics, compiler verification, language interoperability, and secure compilation. Her early work showed how to scale the logical relations proof method to realistic languages, leading to wide use of the technique, including for soundness of advanced type systems such as Rust&amp;rsquo;s, correctness of compiler transformations, verification of concurrent data structures, and as a foundation for the Iris program logic. Her current work includes design and verification of safe FFIs and richer ABIs, and development of RichWasm, a richly typed WebAssembly that supports safe, shared-memory, inter-language linking. She is a frequent lecturer at the Oregon PL Summer School and recently served as Program Chair for OOPSLA and POPL.&lt;/p>
