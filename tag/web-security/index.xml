She received her PhD from the National University of Singapore in 2016. Her research has contributed to techniques in static and dynamic analysis of Android, Java, Node.js, and Client-side JavaScript applications, and most recently supply chain and infrastructure-as-code security. Behnaz has led the Gelato project for web application fuzzing, which was transferred to the SaaS Cloud Security team at Oracle and is now actively finding bugs in Oracle products. Currently, she leads the open-source initiative Macaron, aimed at analyzing software supply chain and infrastructure security issues. Her passion lies in designing tools to empower developers in constructing inherently secure software.&lt;/p>
